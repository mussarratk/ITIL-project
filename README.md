10 mistakes to avoid and 10 steps to follow
ITIL adoption is widespread, with tens of thousands of organizations already reaping its benefits globally. But, as with any new ways of working, there are a number of common ITIL adoption mistakes to avoid—with these applicable to ITIL v3 and the newer ITIL 4.

When you adopt ITIL best practices, it’s important to learn from those who have gone before and the drivers of successes and failures. This will increase the speed and success of your ITIL adoption and likely save you and others heartache.

The top 10 ITIL vision mistakes
Different organizations have different interpretations as to what ITIL is and isn’t. In fact, many common mistakes stem from those involved in ITIL adoption not fully understanding what ITIL is, how it should be used, and the extent to which it will improve IT service delivery and support.

Ten common mistakes to avoid when you’re educating your organization on ITIL adoption are:

1. Believing the goal is "ITIL compliance
ITIL is a service management best practice framework and not a gold standard for your organization to be measured against. Importantly, there’s no such thing as “ITIL-compliance.”
2. Thinking that ITIL is an industry standard.
ITIL is merely guidance. It’s a collection of good things to do, as opposed to a standard that can be measured against or complied with. ITIL is about adopting and adapting, not the blanket application of one fixed set of activities.
3. Viewing ITIL adoption as the desired outcome.
It’s not about doing ITIL but rather using ITIL to achieve better outcomes—so ITIL is not the end (or desired outcome) but the means to an end.
4. Adopting ITIL as a silver bullet.
ITIL will not magically improve everything that’s wrong; however, ITIL will improve operations and outcomes for organizations that commit to the concepts of the ITIL 4 service value chain (or the v3 service lifecycle).
5. Incorrectly positioning ITIL.
Organizations must understand that ITIL is about following guidelines for improving IT and business operations, as opposed to simply adopting ITSM best practices.
6. Running an “ITIL project.”
Instead, it needs to be viewed as a business-focused project, for example, to improve productivity, the speed of innovation, and customer satisfaction to reduce costs, risks, and business debilitating IT issues.
7. Not understanding the difference between ITIL and ITSM.
While there’s a lot of overlap between ITIL and ITSM, they’re not the same thing. Plus, with ITIL 4, the focus is now on service management, not solely ITSM, which helps to facilitate enterprise-wide use of ITIL best practice.
8. Believing that ITIL is the only ITSM framework or standard.
It might be the most popular ITSM approach, but there are many others such as COBIT, ISO/IEC 20000, IT4IT, and VeriSM. In fact, many organizations have applied multiple frameworks to align with their business goals rather than just choosing one.
9. Not appreciating the effort needed for success.
As with any project, insufficient effort will adversely affect the expected results and ROI. This is across people, process, and technology and the investment in organizational change management in particular.
10. Treating ITIL as a one-off project.
Instead, ITIL requires ongoing attention and investment, for continued success. After all, it’s all about continual improvement.
5 key ITIL planning steps
Once you understand what ITIL is and isn’t, there are some key steps to take when planning how your organization is going to adopt ITIL. These include ensuring that you:
1. Create a robust business case.
ITIL needs to be more than a leap of faith that’s done because other organizations are doing it. Successful adoption requires a carefully thought out and articulated roadmap to ITIL success, with the costs and benefits clear to all.
2. Start your planning with an agreed ITIL and ITSM vision.
What are your short through long-term goals for where ITIL will take your organization? What happens after the new ITIL practices have been introduced? These and other questions will need to be answered before moving forward.
3. Fully appreciate the required timeframe for change.
It’s critical to build out a realistic ITIL adoption timeline. Importantly, ITIL adoption extends beyond the timeframe for technological implementation, and a phased approach is usually better than a “big bang” ITIL adoption.
4. Get your people approach right.
This includes not valuing ITIL qualifications over experience, work ethic, and common sense. You also need to place sufficient focus on people and organizational change management for what is ultimately a change in the way of working.
5. Avoid planning for ITIL in a vacuum.
Required linkages exist between different ITSM or IT management practices and integrations to consider— even if they’re a future enhancement. Plus, be sure to involve end users early, as they’ll be the true test of whether ITIL is a success.
5 key implementation steps
So, you have a solid vision and a plan, what else is needed for your ITIL adoption? Some of the following five key steps are purely implementation-related, but others have strong links back to getting the ITIL vision and planning right. Ensure that you:
1. Avoid the term “ITIL implementation.”
Unfortunately, “implementation” can encourage people to focus on the technology at the expense of organizational change management. Or they might miss that ITIL is a certain mindset and a specific approach to IT delivery and support.
2. Don’t aim for perfection from the outset.
Instead, get the basics right first. ITIL is about improvement, but that improvement doesn’t need to all come at once. Yet, don’t ignore ITIL’s enabling practices such as continual improvement and knowledge management.
3. Appreciate the need for more than the technology.
Technology alone can’t deliver the optimal outcomes of ITIL adoption. For example, the right people can work with less-than-perfect technology, but the right technology will struggle in the hands of the wrong people.
4. Focus on more than the easy stuff.
It’s human nature to start with the easiest stuff and get to the more difficult stuff later; however, organizations often fail to progress past ITIL’s easier, reactive elements to proactive elements such as availability management. If these are valuable, consider an early rather than delayed introduction.
5. Use project staff well.
Third-party resources can be badly managed—for example, when consultants aren’t focused on higher value-add activities and there’s no knowledge transfer to employees. Another example is when key internal people aren’t freed up from their day jobs to participate.
How do most companies start with ITIL?
This is a question that can only be answered with “it depends” because it really does depend on the challenges and opportunities an organization needs to address.

Traditionally, organizations start with one of these three pairs of activities:
Incident and problem management
Incident and change management (now called “change control” in ITIL 4)
Change and configuration management (now called “service configuration management” in ITIL 4
Incident, change, and problem management have traditionally been the three most commonly adopted ITIL practices. More recently though, the importance of continual improvement at the outset of ITIL adoption is now commonly recommended. It makes sense because ITIL is about improvement and, assuming that you don’t start with perfection, your organization will need the ability to improve over time. Additionally, self-service and service catalog are now more commonly in the mix for organizations starting with ITIL.

Ultimately, your organization should start with the ITIL practices that will make the biggest difference to IT, business operations, and outcomes.
